Reflection from a programming perspective
- Could have utilised a more event driven approach to maximise performance.
- Could have followed the command pattern, and created classes for each possible action. This would allow for finer control of the actions, and avoid the prospect of creating one bloated controls class.
- Simplified method/variable names to ensure clean real estate, and easier code readability.
- Optimise nested forloops to avoid BigO(n^2) scenarios.
